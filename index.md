## When to use "Hyphenation"

- **When we write age before a noun, we use hyphens**. 
-- For example: *eighteen-year-old students*.
-- No needed if: *the students are eighteen years old*

- **For numbers before the noun**. 
-- For example: *a two-door car*.
-- No needed if: *a car with two doors*

- **Always in numbers from twenty-one to ninety-ninen (thirty-one, forthy-two, etc)**. 
-- For example: *twenty-one*, *two hundred and ninety-nine*.
-- No needed if: *two hundred*

*Note: Never use hyphens in compound adjectives that have an adverb which ends in -ly. For example: "...a carefully written letter"*.

## Subject and object pronouns

From Madina's chat (Cambly):

> An object pronoun receives the action of the verb in a sentence and a subject pronoun is the one doing the action. For example, **They gave us the keys**. In this sentence, **they** is the subject (giving the keys) and **us** is the object (receiving the keys).

### Subject pronouns

- They are the subject of a verb.
-- For example: ***She** hates mushrooms.*
-- For example: ***I** am studying English.*

### Object pronouns

- The object of a verb.
-- For example: *John knows **me**.*
-- For example: *The dog licked **him**.*

- After a preposition (including after phrasal).
-- For example: *It's important to **me**.*
-- For example: *Keep up with **us**!*

- After **be**.
-- For example: *Who's there? It's **me**!*
-- For example: *It was **him**.*

- After short answers.
-- For example: *A: Who's there? B: **Him**!*
-- For example: *A: I'm tired. B: **Me** too.*

- After **as** and **than** for comparison.
-- For example: *She is as tall as **me**.*
-- For example: *He is taller than **her**.*
  It is also possible to use the _subject pronoun_ + _a verb_ in the same situation.
  -- For example: *She is taller than **I am**.*
  -- For example: *He is taller than **she is**.*

- After **but** and **except**.
-- For example: *Everybody went home early but **me**.*
-- For example: *Everybody went home early except **him**.*

## Elder vs elderly

- **Elder** is used for someone who is superior to another or others. 
-- For example: _My **elder** brother has got married._ It's talking about my brother who is older than I am but not necessarily an old man.

- **Elderly** is used for aged people. 
-- For example: His **elderly** brother has passed away_. It's talking about his brother who might be either older or younger than he is and definitely an old man.

> The phrase **The elderly** is used to refer to a group of old citizens.

### About _elder_ and _older_
**Elder** and **older** are both adjectives that mean "more advanced in age." **Older** can be used of people and things ('an **older** sibling;' 'an **older** house'), but **elder** can only be used of people ('the **elder** son'). Additionally, **elder** can be used as a noun ('respect your **elders**').
